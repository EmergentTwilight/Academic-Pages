# Biography

I am a third-year undergraduate student majoring in **Computer Science and Technology** at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/). I am a member of the **Advanced Class of Engineering Education (ACEE)** within the prestigious **Chu Kochen Honors College**. **Rank 1** in cohort (GPA: 4.76/5.00).

Currently, I am a research assistant at the [State Key Lab of CAD&CG](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/), working under the supervision of Prof. [Zhaopeng Cui](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/zhpcui/). My ongoing research project focuses on physics-informed multi-modal 3D reconstruction.

My research interests broadly lie in **3D Vision**, **Dynamic Scene Modeling** and **World Models**. I am driven by the goal of *empowering intelligent agents to perceive, reason, and act effectively within the complex physical world*. Specifically, I am interested in:
- **High-Fidelity Reconstruction**: Developing robust algorithms to reconstruct large-scale environments from multi-modal data, providing digital twins for real-world applications.
- **Physics-Aware Modeling**: Integrating physical laws into neural representations to model dynamic objects ensuring reliable generalization in unseen scenarios.
- **Generalizable World Models**: Leveraging physically consistent environments to build predictive world models that enable embodied agents to safely interact with the unstructured real world.
